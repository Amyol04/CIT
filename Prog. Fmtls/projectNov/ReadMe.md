Create a student practice quiz program that gathers the first name and surname, allowing students to choose between a Maths quiz or a Language quiz. 
For Maths, prompt the number of questions, randomly select addition or subtraction, and generate questions from the 1 to 12 times tables, ensuring no negative or decimal answers. 
Evaluate answers, count correct responses, and print the percentage grade with child-friendly emojis. Display each question and, if incorrect, the correct answer. For Language, ask for the difficulty level,
present words for translation, and assess responses, printing the grade and detailed feedback. After completing a quiz, ask if the student wants to take another. Log each test's details (name, date, subject, level, and grade).
Upon finishing practice, display the average score across all tests in the session.
