            Finding Nemo is a 2003 American computer-animated family film produced by
            Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It tells the
            story of the overprotective ocellaris clownfish named Marlin who, along
            with a regal blue tang named Dory, searches for his abducted son Nemo all
            the way to Sydney Harbour. Along the way, Marlin learns to take risks and
            comes to terms with Nemo taking care of himself.
